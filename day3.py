Words can't express how impressed I am.

 

You've got a keen eye for the math magic. One last request, and our mail situation should be smooth sailing. The wizards in the math workshop had one more thing to add – if we use the same magic number to secure all the letters, and if one of these impostors did manage to find it, then any past or future letters would be just as able to be stolen as they were before. But they said there's a trick – if each letter is tagged with its own pair of magic numbers, we could use that to change the game.

 

So what they proposed is this:

Wishlists magically appear on Santa's desk, and the trusted helper elves send it along the conveyor to the fulfillment workshop where they're digitized and emailed out to the whole of North Pole. So if the helper elves stamp two magic numbers, one we'll call A, the other B on the letter, the fulfillment workshop can process them in the order they're received, where they multiply A with the current magic number and use this to secure the message. Then they take B, and multiply this by the current magic number, and that becomes the new magic number for the next message. They also said something about all this needing to use that weird module thing again, but I still have no idea what they're talking about. But you seem to, so they gave these examples:

 

Modulus: 2147483647

Current Magic Number: 837382093

Letter 1: 1928718283, 592838292

Letter 2: 574838210, 473827192

Letter 3: 1229183931, 2038183743

 

And this would produce an output in the format of [[Security Number, Next Magic Number], ...]:

[[771911109, 733635931],[795707849,567604930],[1607178695,1820364332]]

 

Your data has been provided below, so send back the output in the same format of [[Security Number, Next Magic Number], ...]

 

Input:

Modulus: 2147483647

Current Magic Number: 1041121128

Letter 1: 845111250, 428392478

Letter 2: 850150138, 611613554

Letter 3: 1733672284, 94841250

 

Enter your solution:
